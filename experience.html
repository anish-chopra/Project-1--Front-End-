        <p>
          My professional experience at the moment has nothing to do with web
          design or development. I was an insurance broker for almost 10 years.
          Prior to that I worked at Future Shop, which was kind of like Canada's
          Best Buy before Best Buy bought them and changed all the names.

        <p>
          I know everything about electronics, music and DJing. I used to love
          DJing although I also never pursued it professionaly. Although I wish
          it wasn't the case, I also know everything there is to know about home
          and auto insurance....Boooorriiinnggg!!!

          If you have any questions for me feel free to reach out anytime. I
          love to chat!

        <p>
          Here is a section where I am saying more things. Things are wonderful.
          I am fairly fond of things. I will now for no apparant reason proceed
          to list my fav rappers:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>Eminem</li>
          <li>Notorious BIG</li>
          <li>J Cole</li>
          <li>Method Man</li>
          <li>Taylor Swift</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In addition to rap, I also love rock, dance, pop, french house, and
          anything else that sounds good. Currently, as I am typing this, I am
          listening to one of the greatest songs of all time. Lady by Modjo.
