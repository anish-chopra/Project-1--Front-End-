          Hi Everyone! I'm Anish, and I am currently taking Treehouse's Front
          End Web Development Techdegree. I was born and raised in Toronto,
          Canada, and spent the last 10 years working as an Insurance Agent. I
          also used to love DJing, hence the picture of a DJ used as my
          background image. I have always been interested in web design but
          never had the opportunity to pursue it professionaly. I am excited to
          learn everything this Techdegree has to offer in the hopes of becoming
          a web developer one day.
        </p>
        <p>Wish me luck!</p>

        <p>
          I want to learn everything about building web sites and programming. I
          would love learn more about:
        </p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My dream job is working as a Software Engineer for a top firm like
          Shopify. They are a huge e-commerce company, and best of all, they're
          based right in my backyard here in Canada. I think that this front end
          web dev techdegree is the first step in pursuing my dream.
